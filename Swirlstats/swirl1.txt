| The easiest way to create a vector is with the c() function, which stands for 'concatenate' or 'combine'. To create a
| vector containing the numbers 1.1, 9, and 3.14, type c(1.1, 9, 3.14). Try it now and store the result in a variable called
| z.

| Behind the scenes, R is 'recycling' the 2 to make a vector of 2s and the 100 to make a vector of 100s. In other words, when
| you ask R to compute z * 2 + 100, what it really computes is this: z * c(2, 2, 2) + c(100, 100, 100).
